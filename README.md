Same as 1-1.

##### state how to reproduce the result shown in your presentation
1. To show the loss, accuracy, weights, gradient norm plots, open 
```
jupyter notebook CIFAR10_plot.ipynb
```
(However, the weights to produce weight plot is not available due to large filesize.)

2. To show minimal ratio results, open
```
jupyter notebook mini_ratio_experiment.ipynb
```
